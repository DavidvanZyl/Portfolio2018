# Portfolio2018

This is my initial portfolio for the year, no doubt I will re-do it a few times and change a lot.
Its simple and minimal, and for the most part just a POC. 

Its built in Angular using SCSS.
The main page animations were an experiment with angulars own animation tools and while don't work as well as I had hoped, are passable.

As with any angular app, if you'd like to run this locally, simply clone it and then: 
```
npm i
```
Followed by:
```
ng serve --o
```

It will print an ip to the console, at which your dev server will automatically reload with any saved changes.
